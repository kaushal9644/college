# SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
1. Front End Development:<br>
        ● HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Structure the content of the website using HTML
        markup. Create pages for different sections such as home, about, academics, admissions,
        etc.<br>
        ● CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Design the visual layout and appearance of the website
        using CSS. Apply styles to HTML elements to achieve a cohesive and attractive look.<br>
        ● JavaScript: Enhance the interactivity and functionality of the website using JavaScript.
        Implement features such as form validation, dynamic content loading, and interactive
        elements like sliders or accordions.<br>
2. Back End Development:<br>
        ● Servlets: Use Java Servlets to handle HTTP requests and generate dynamic content on the
        server-side. Implement servlets to process form submissions, handle user authentication,
        and interact with the database.<br>
        ● JSP (Java Pages): Create JSP pages to generate dynamic HTML content based on data
        received from the servlets. Embed Java code within JSP pages to perform logic
        operations, iterate over data, and dynamically generate HTML output.<br>
        ● JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Use JDBC to connect Java applications, including
        servlets and JSP pages, to the database. Implement database operations such as querying,
        inserting, updating, and deleting data to interact with the college's backend database
        system.<br>

3. Integration:<br>
        ● Integrate the front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with the back end (Servlets, JSP, JDBC)
        to create a cohesive web application.<br>
        ● Implement communication between the front end and back end using HTTP requests and
        responses. Use AJAX techniques for asynchronous communication to enhance user
        experience and minimize page reloads.<br>
        
4. Setting Up MySQL Database:<br>
        ● Install MySQL Server on your development environment or use a hosted MySQL service.<br>
        ● Create a new database schema for your college website project.<br>
        ● Define tables and relationships to store data related to students, courses, faculty, events,
        etc.<br>
5. Establishing JDBC Connection:<br>
        ● Configure JDBC connection properties such as the database URL, username, and
        password.<br>
        ● Use the “java.sql.DriverManager” class to establish a connection to the MySQL database.<br>
6. Executing SQL Queries:<br>
        ● Write SQL queries to perform database operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and
        DELETE.<br>
        ● Use `java.sql.Statement` or `java.sql.PreparedStatement` to execute SQL queries and
        retrieve results.<br>
7. Processing Results:<br>
        ● Retrieve and process query results using `java.sql.resultset’.<br>
        ● Iterate over the ResultSet to fetch rows of data and map them to Java objects or display
        them on web pages.<br>
8. Closing Database Resources:<br>
        ● Properly close JDBC resources such as Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement, and
        ResultSet to release database connections and prevent resource leaks.<br>
        ● Use try-with-resources or finally blocks to ensure resources are closed even in case of
        exceptions.<br>
9. Testing and Error Handling:<br>
        ● Test database interactions thoroughly using unit tests and integration tests.<br>
        ● Implement error handling and logging to handle exceptions gracefully and troubleshoot
        issues.<br>

                          Here's a simple example demonstrating JDBC usage with MySQL in Java:
                          package db;
                          import java.sql.Connection;
                          import java.sql.DriverManager;
                          import java.sql.SQLException;
                          import java.sql.Statement;
                          public class DB {
                          static Connection con =null;
                          static Statement st=null;
                          static
                          {
                          try{
                          Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
                          System.out.print("Driver load..");
                          }catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {
                          System.out.println("Class Not Found");
                          }
                          try{
                          con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/college","root","kaushal");
                          st=con.createStatement();
                          }
                          catch(SQLException e){
                          System.out.print(e);
                          }
                          }
                          public static Statement getStatement()
                          {
                          return st;
                          }
                          public static Connection getConnection()
                          {
                          return con
                          } }
   
10. Testing and Debugging:<br>
          ● Test the website thoroughly to ensure functionality, compatibility, and responsiveness
          across different browsers and devices.<br>
          ● Debug issues and errors in both the front end and back end code. Use browser developer
          tools and server-side logging to identify and fix bugs efficiently.<br>
11. Deployment:<br>
          ● Deploy the website to a web server or application server. Configure the server
          environment to support Java-based web applications.<br>
          ● Set up database connectivity and ensure that the web application can establish
          connections to the backend database using JDBC.<br>
12. Maintenance and Optimization:<br>
          ● Regularly maintain and update the website to add new features, fix bugs, and improve
          performance and security.<br>
          ● Optimize the website's code, assets, and database queries to enhance speed, efficiency,
          and scalability.<br>
          ● Monitor server performance, uptime, and user traffic to identify areas for optimization
          and scalability improvements.<br>
